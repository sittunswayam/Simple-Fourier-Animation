Approximating Signals using Fourier coefficients (Animations)

This code approximates simple two dimensional signals with their Fourier coefficients. As the number of coefficients grows, the approximation becomes more and more accurate. One can see the ringing artifacts due to Gibbs phenomenon on the signal edges.
